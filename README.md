### This repo contains a few projects of me learning the rust programming language, the bevy game engine, etc.

There is only one branch, and possible releases of functioning versions (like
snapshots)

I will ***NOT*** be accepting any pull-requests, as this is only for learning.

*This is in the public domain. Feel free to use this code for any purpose.*
