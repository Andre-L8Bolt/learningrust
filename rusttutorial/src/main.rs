//INT OVERFLOW:
//Relying on integer overflowâ€™s wrapping behavior is considered an error.
//
//To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families of methods that the standard library provides on primitive numeric types:
//
//    Wrap in all modes with the wrapping_* methods, such as wrapping_add
//    Return the None value if there is overflow with the checked_* methods
//    Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the overflowing_* methods
//    Saturate at the value's minimum or maximum values with saturating_* methods
